# PWA-Text-Editor [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]
 
  ## Description

  This project challenge was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. It is a single page application using PWA's and multiple data persistence techniques to serve as redundencies. The application functions offline. We used the package idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API.
